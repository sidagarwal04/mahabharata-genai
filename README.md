# Background
Have you ever been captivated by a story brimming with complex relationships? Stories like the Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic, weave a spell with a multitude of characters and their intricate connections. These connections - familial bonds, alliances, rivalries - form the very foundation of the narrative, driving the plot and shaping the destinies of its heroes and villains.

It all began with a simple conversation. My wife, engrossed in C. Rajagopalachari's masterful translation of the Mahabharata, sparked my curiosity about the intricate web of relationships within the epic. The idea of translating these connections into a powerful graph model, leveraging the capabilities of [Neo4j](www.neo4j.com) (a leader in Graph Database Industry), became an irresistible challenge.
